FZ Jülich guest house laundry panels
####################################

The washing and drying machine in the FZ Jülich (research center Jülich) guest
house are labeled in German only. Due to the nature of the guest house most
people staying there do not speak German very well. This makes it harder than
needed to do the laundry.

The SVG files contain the front panel of the appliance with English text. That
way it should be possible to use them well without speaking German at all.
